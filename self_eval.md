# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
# I feel confident with the built-in Ruby methods
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
# I feel fairly confident in writing simple methods, I feel I have learned a lot today on the methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
# I would still like to know where in the world we would use some of these methods, my brain definitely functions with a "Why" method.
